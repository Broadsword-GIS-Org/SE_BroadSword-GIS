Insert Node JS writeup here....

Node.js is not a database but databases such as MongoDB and PostGreSQL offer Node.js drivers that can manipulate their databases. For example.

Say we have a MongoDB. We can then connect to the DB using our driver.
//variable to access and retrieve the database
var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

// Connect to the db
MongoClient.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/exampleDb", function(err, db) {
  if(!err) {
    console.log("We are connected");
  }
});

If successful "We are connected" should be printed

CRUD, Searching, Querying the DB and many other database manipulations are also offered with the driver. So basically we can use it in conjunction with our chosen database.
